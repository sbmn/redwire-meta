# redwire-meta
An experimental language for Minecraft redstone.

This is the repository for the creation of standards for the language, Redwire. This is not a compiler, but rather a technical guide for how Redwire's syntax works, and how to apply knowledge of the language. If any compilers are made, then we will add them below.

If there is ever a compiler made for redwire, a new repository will be made. If you would like to contribute to this project, please do so by going into /dev or contributing to compilers.
